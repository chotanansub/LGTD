# Real-World Datasets

This directory contains real-world time series datasets used for evaluating LGTD and baseline methods.

## Datasets

### 1. ETT (Electricity Transformer Temperature)

**Description:**
Multivariate time series data from electrical power transformers, including oil temperature and load data. Part of the Electricity Transformer Temperature (ETT) benchmark dataset.

**Variants:**
- **ETTh1**: Hourly data from transformer 1
- **ETTh2**: Hourly data from transformer 2

**Variables:**
- Oil temperature (OT)
- High useful load (HUFL)
- High useless load (HULL)
- Middle useful load (MUFL)
- Middle useless load (MULL)
- Low useful load (LUFL)
- Low useless load (LULL)

**Source:**
Introduced in the Informer paper (Zhou et al., AAAI 2021)

### 2. Sunspot Number

**Description:**
Monthly mean total sunspot number from the Sunspot Index and Long-term Solar Observations (SILSO) World Data Center. This dataset records solar activity through sunspot counts observed over centuries.

**Variables:**

```

**URL:**

**Characteristics:**
- Frequency: Monthly
- Length: Variable (depends on selected time range)
- Univariate time series
- Well-known ~11-year solar cycle
- Historical data dating back to 1749

## Data Preprocessing

For both datasets, preprocessing includes:

1. **Missing Value Handling**: Interpolation or forward-fill for missing observations
2. **Normalization**: Optional standardization (zero mean, unit variance)
3. **Train/Test Split**: Chronological split for evaluation
4. **Window Selection**: Extract representative windows for decomposition experiments

## Usage in Paper

These datasets are used to:
- Evaluate LGTD on real-world time series with unknown periodicities
- Compare decomposition quality against baseline methods
- Demonstrate generalization to different domains (power systems, astronomical observations)
- Test robustness on data with irregular patterns and noise

Results are reported in:
- **Table 4**: Quantitative decomposition metrics on real-world datasets
- **Figure 5**: Visual comparison of decomposition results
